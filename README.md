KAOOA: TRADITIONAL ABSTRACT STRATEGY HUNT GAME FROM INDIA
Kaooa, otherwise known as "Vulture and Crows" is a traditional game from India. Like Len Choa ("Tiger and Leopards") and Fox and Geese, it is a hunt game. Hunt games often pit one player with one token against a second player who has multiple tokens. As you can tell, the tokens usually are named after animals, a fun dynamic that adds a little imaginative spirit to the game. Caw! Caw!

Kaooa game board and tokens
Kaooa is unique in that it uses a pentagram, or star-shaped, board, similar to the one person game, Pentalpha. It is easy to make your own game board, and if your kids want, they can get really artsy and decorate it however they want!

Five-pointed star game board.
